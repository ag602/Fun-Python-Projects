# Fun-and-Tricky-Python-Projects 
PROJECT-1

IIT(BHU) Completed it's 100 years in 2019. I was lucky enough to be the Technical Head of this event!
The event was a huge success with a total guest count of around 600, thanks to the 40-member team of Student Alumni Interaction Cell(SAIC), who spent sleepless nights to take care of the guests in every possible way. But, after the event one thing I got to know that many alumni didn't even got an invite. 
The database which we had till now was scattered and completely out of order. I pulled out all the Cell's google drive csv/xlsx files containing any sort of alumni data and put into a single folder.
Then I made this python script which iterates through all the rows of every worksheet of every workbook to find a keyword say "1956" and simply add that whole row into a new file naming "1956". This made all the data which was scattered lets say of 1956 batch into one file naming 1956.xlsx!!
It really helped SAIC to find the data in just one go. Hopefully, this time we wont miss anyone:)
